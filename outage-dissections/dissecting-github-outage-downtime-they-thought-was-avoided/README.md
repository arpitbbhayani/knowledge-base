Has it ever happened to you that you anticipated that something would go wrong, you pro-actively fixed it, but it still went wrong? This exact thing happened to GitHub on March 1, 2021, in a situation for which they were prepared for 6 months. This is a very amusing incident as it teaches us a lot about the blind spots that exist in every system out there.

In this video, we talk about an outage that GitHub faced with their Actions service. and take an in-depth look into what happened, why it actually happened, and what GitHub did to prepare for this very situation, but it still went wrong.

## Hi, I'm Arpit Bhayani üëã

<img width="256px" src="https://arpitbhayani.me/static/img/arpit.jpg" />

In my last **~10** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like _Search_, _Notification_, _Logging_, _Deployment Engine_, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

I also run a YouTube channel [#AsliEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani) where I post 3 videos every week spanning topics like System Design, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and any interesting CS concept in general.

You can find details about upcoming cohort üëá‚Äç Hope to see you soon there.
