Rate Limiter took down GitHub

Dissecting GitHub Outage Downtime due to Rate Limiter Rate limiters are meant to avoid downtime , but GitHub went down due to a rate limiter ? what happened luihile using A large fraction of users saw errors GitHub -7 The affected users were part of an AIB experiment what is AIB experiment ? Data lies never To better quantify which variation is , we run A / B test . Control Test A fraction of users are shown variation shown behaviour while others are existing . By observing key metrics by variation , cue can variation not quantity if is positive or . When in doubt run an AIB experiment .

AIB at GitHub ← Generates config file returns dynamically and AIB Service < > Config generator need config file a ↑ n > L 4 > } Frontend servers ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥¥¥ A configuration file is dynamically generated and sent upon request to to frontend servers . The config is used run very granular AIB tests . What failed ? Because of a lot of request . the file was not generated for all the servers . Request was rate limited by the config generator . the variation !! Hence all the users part of group got affected * Rate limiting [ even internal ) is essential , well ! but limits should be tuned

and itigation long term fix GitHub team quickly disabled their dependence on this file and this restored the services to all the users long - term fix : configuration file to be computed and cached and sent to all who need it instead of making runtime requests . Key takeways - Avoid synchronous dependencies ↳ make communication a her ever possible sync Cee - Rate limiters are great ↳ but tune them well - Have higher limits for tier 1 services - Create tier of services and classify your services depending the on criticality .
