Auth small , autonomous , harmonic core idea : Divide and Conquer Search Payments Break into manageable a product sub problems and tackle each order Delivery - one of them separately . Each sub problem solved separately and * is optimally - why micro services ? Idea MVP > Product prototype > > More - codebase overtime features grows f. - difficult to co-ordinate module by one team break others change in one can - - reduces product development velocity
