Things to remember while building Microservices
===


Microservices are much more than an engineering problem to solve and let's look at some key engineering and non-engineering things to remember while building them.

## Growth Opportunity

Microservices are a great growth opportunity given there are so many engineering and non-engineering challenges to solve. Every engineer or early leader should grab this opportunity to showcase his/her prowess and earn leadership brownie points.

## Conflicts are inevitable

Engineers are passionate, and intra-team and inter-team conflicts are inevitable. But the conflicts should be gracefully by

- taking data-driven informed decisions
- consulting senior engineers
- sometimes moving on without creating a fuss

## Architecture Evolves

Vision evolves and so would our architecture. The decisions we took while building it might not be the best today and hence we should be okay with the code getting scrapped and seeing some dramatic changes in the flow.

## Technical Debt

We cannot always build a Microservice in the best way possible. Engineering teams are always running against time and aim at delivering things quicker.

This requires us to cut some corners and make some inefficient decisions and this is called Technical Debt. Over time such debt piles up and reduces the development velocity.

It is important to clean up technical debt periodically, by reserving ~10% of the bandwidth of every engineer every sprint.

## Enforcing Standardizations

Standardizations are essential for microservices as it provides a clear set of guidelines to use for building them.

To ensure that every team is not building and setting up their conventions from scratch, we create a Template that everyone can use and build on top of it. This aligns with the DRY principle ensuring we do not waste time doing repeated things.

Some engineers and teams might see standardization as strangling, and hence we might see a potential backlash. In order to ensure this is adopted smoothly

- we should have a forum that decides the standards instead of a central team
- the forum should have proper reasoning behind every decision taken for the template

This would help us keep such templates and best practices inclusive while ensuring a positive sentiment all around.

## Business over Engineering

This is offensive, but it is true. Engineering exists because the business does and hence while building microservices we should always remain aligned with the strategic goals.

For example, if the business priority is profitability we should not have over-provisioned microservices that leak money.

An engineer working on Microservices should not only just focus on engineering; there are so many other aspects to look at that holds the potential to create massive impact. To be honest, Building microservices is much more than an engineering problem to solve. There are many pitfalls to avoid and decisions to make and build a solid functional high-performing team in the process.

In this video, we look at some engineering and non-engineering things to remember while building Microservices, like it is a massive Growth Opportunity, everyone should be okay with architecture evolution, the importance of periodically addressing Technical Debt, and striking the right balance to keep engineering and business aligned to the same strategic goals.

Outline:

00:00 Agenda
02:53 Massive scope for growth
05:11 Conflicts are inevitable
11:15 Architecture Evolves
13:36 Technical Debt
16:39 Backlash while enforcing standardization
20:47 Business more critical than engineering

# Arpit's System Design Masterclass

> A masterclass that helps you become great at designing _scalable_, _fault-tolerant_, and _highly available_ systems.

## The Program

This is a prime and intermediate-level cohort-based course aimed at providing an exclusive and crisp learning experience. The program will cover most of the topics under System Design and Software Architecture including but not limited to - _Architecting Social Networks_, _Building Storage Engines_ and, _Designing High Throughput Systems_.

The program will have a blend of Live Classes happening on Weekends, and 1:1 Mentorship sessions. The program is designed to be intense and crisp to accelerate the overall learning. We tackle every system from the [First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) and build the solid foundation to architect any system in the future.


## Highlights

 - The course has been taken up by __500+__ people, spanning __9__ countries.
 - People from companies like Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Yelp, Github, Flipkart, Practo, Grab, PayPal, and many more, have taken up this course.


## Hi, I'm Arpit Bhayani üëã

<img width="256px" src="https://arpitbhayani.me/static/img/arpit.jpg" />

In my last **~10** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like _Search_, _Notification_, _Logging_, _Deployment Engine_, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

I also run a YouTube channel [#AsliEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani) where I post 3 videos every week spanning topics like System Design, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and any interesting CS concept in general.

You can find details about upcoming cohort üëá‚Äç Hope to see you soon there.
