How does the database guarantee reliability using write-ahead logging? [ in a gist ]

Any persistence database needs to guarantee the reliability, implying that any update/delete fired on the database is reliably stored on the disk. The alterations on the data should not be affected by power loss, OS failure, or hardware failure.

To update a certain row of the database, the database engine first reads the block in the memory, performs the update, and flushes the block to the disk. The database engine writes the updates on the blocks that represent the table data and the indexes during the flush.

What if, just before the flush, the database process crashed? The changes that remained in the memory are lost. How do databases prevent this? The answer is super-simple

‚ú® Write-ahead Logging ‚ú®

Write-ahead logging is a standard way to ensure data integrity and reliability. Any changes made on the database are first logged in an append-only file called write-ahead Log or Commit Log. Then the blocks on the disk are updated.

An operation like Update Query, Delete Query is logged in the commit log and not the actual changes making the write lightning-fast.

‚ú® Advantages of using WAL

¬†- we can skip flushing the data to the disk on every update
¬†- significantly reduce the number of disk writes
¬†- we can recover the data in case of a data loss
¬†- we can have point-in-time snapshots

‚ú® Data integrity in WAL

WAL also takes care of its data integrity by writing a CRC-32 before logging the operation. This CRC is checked during reading and replicating.


Any persistent database needs to guarantee reliability. No matter how big or small the changes are, they should survive any reboots, OS, or hardware crashes once they are committed. All the persistent databases use a write-ahead logging technique to guarantee such reliability while not affecting the performance.

In this video, we talk about write-ahead logging, how it ensures reliability, a few solid advantages of using it, one of them being a massive database performance boost, and how the log files are structured on the disk.

# Arpit's System Design Masterclass

> A masterclass that helps you become great at designing _scalable_, _fault-tolerant_, and _highly available_ systems.

## The Program

This is a prime and intermediate-level cohort-based course aimed at providing an exclusive and crisp learning experience. The program will cover most of the topics under System Design and Software Architecture including but not limited to - _Architecting Social Networks_, _Building Storage Engines_ and, _Designing High Throughput Systems_.

The program will have a blend of Live Classes happening on Weekends, and 1:1 Mentorship sessions. The program is designed to be intense and crisp to accelerate the overall learning. We tackle every system from the [First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) and build the solid foundation to architect any system in the future.


## Highlights

 - The course has been taken up by __500+__ people, spanning __9__ countries.
 - People from companies like Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Yelp, Github, Flipkart, Practo, Grab, PayPal, and many more, have taken up this course.


## Hi, I'm Arpit Bhayani üëã

<img width="256px" src="https://arpitbhayani.me/static/img/arpit.jpg" />

In my last **~10** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like _Search_, _Notification_, _Logging_, _Deployment Engine_, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

I also run a YouTube channel [#AsliEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani) where I post 3 videos every week spanning topics like System Design, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and any interesting CS concept in general.

You can find details about upcoming cohort üëá‚Äç Hope to see you soon there.
