In this video, we generate 5 million + random rows in less than 100 seconds using just SQL. We mock the data for any taxonomy (Udemy's example taken). We use Joins and SQL tricks to amplify the rows and use them to ingest.

## Hi, I'm Arpit Bhayani üëã

<img width="256px" src="https://arpitbhayani.me/static/img/arpit.jpg" />

In my last **~10** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like _Search_, _Notification_, _Logging_, _Deployment Engine_, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

I also run a YouTube channel [#AsliEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani) where I post 3 videos every week spanning topics like System Design, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and any interesting CS concept in general.

You can find details about upcoming cohort üëá‚Äç Hope to see you soon there.
