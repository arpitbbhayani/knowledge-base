this is honest python, and here we learn about python internals.
by exploring the python source code, we'll be trying to find answers to questions like how python implements really long integers, how types like list sets and dictionaries implemented in python, what kind of algorithms power this language, how python performs and implements garbage collections.
while exploring all of these things, we will also be altering a lot of source code and will be implementing some really fun yet weird features to the language.
so if this sounds exciting to you, hop along with me on this journey, give a subscribe to this channel and i'll see you in the next one.
