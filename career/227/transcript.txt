so one of the piping hot questions floating around is Will AI replace programmers so here's my take on it I will not put out any biased views over here but let me talk about it in a very rational very realistic way so before we understand yeah like before we answer this question we need to understand how we advance as a specie how humans have advanced over time so what we can very clearly see that there is a pattern that we advance with technology now this technology is not just coding or programming Technologies anything that has made our lives simpler we typically offload boring and tedious and repetitive and mundane tasks to machines or to animals right for example walking was tedious we built bicycles hunting got tedious got repetitive we started Agriculture and domestication taking out water from Wells was repetitive we built Motors to pump the water out stitching clothes was mundane we built sewing machines calculations were repetitive boring inefficient we built calculators to do so we built computers to make it better we taught computers that hey now we can rather program computers and that's why we are making our lives simpler by the day and that's what is so beautiful about us as a specie as a human species and that's amazing right so as a knack humans have this ability we can very clearly identify the repetitives and the mundanes and we replace it with something much more efficient so that we get time to do something meaningful if if it was not for that Knack we would still be rubbing sticks to create fire we don't do that anymore right we have matchsticks to get it done very easily so given this we have to know that whenever we find any work literally anywhere as mundane or repetitive as boring or tedious or inefficient we will find out a way to replace it with something much more much better giving us the time to focus on something meaningful with meaningful in mind let me tell you this that we as civilization we as humans We crave meaningful work and it is very evident very evident from the way we switch companies we switch companies because we get bored by doing that same thing again and again if a company does not give us meaningful work what do we do we switch we switch in we switch with a hope that other company will give us winning full work so if we are there because we all crave meaningful work it's very clear that when that work itself becomes tedious or mundane we would find a way to automate it right which is where every like understand this over time every single job every single I'm not just talking about coding over here every single activity that we do becomes mundane and we find a better way to do it so every job over time will be eradicated but it does not mean that we would not have anything else to do there would be new things that we would be we would be focusing on right it's really important for us to understand this right okay so when the jobs from software engineering domain will go like for example like software engine software engineering jobs didn't exist until late 80s right no one knew like we could program computers that when that came up a new set of jobs came up and now we are talking about it that hey Will AI replace our jobs will AI replace programming or not right so it's clear that programming jobs will vanish but the real question is when it's not definitely not going to happen overnight you have to understand it's a really long process for example the activities that I mentioned it took us quite a bit of time to get rid of that and to be honest we have not like this still exist in some proportion for example when someone says that AI will eat your job understand this it is not going like it is not going to happen overnight the complete eradication will happen over a really long time so don't go very berserk about it that is going to eat me so why should I even work right but it's important to understand that every single job will be getting replaced or will be getting eradicated somewhere down the line but it does not mean it would happen overnight Okay so it's important to understand this and what we have done is we have seen AI do a lot of stuff we have seen AI writing a book we have seen AI producing songs we have seen AI producing music we have seen AI automatically editing videos we have seen AI doing generative digital art and even programming so who like the question is what will AI replace if it's not going to happen overnight what is AI going to replace so this is where what we should understand is Job Hierarchy now Job Hierarchy is always a pyramid where majority of people always do mundane tedious work now this mundane tedious work is relative it's not that it's absolute money that I like anyone else can do but it's more of that it's relatively mundane within that pyramid right and now in that pyramid as you climb higher you are doing more and more meaningful job the automation will always start eating up from the bottom we have seen it with Industrial Revolution where how the repetitive and mundane task was automated by machines industrialization is a classic example of that now understand this when I talk about this pyramid it does not mean that the co sits at the top and the software engineer one sits at the bottom it's more about the kind of impact output and outcome your work brings to the organization that's how your work is Meaningful if your work is Meaningful you are not at the bottom of the pyramid so you need to understand what this job high like where you are placed in This Job Hierarchy and I'm again iterating it's not a designation hierarchy it's about the quality of the work that you are doing the advancements that would happen not just with AI but anything would start eating up from the base of this pyramid and I'll give an example no code tools didn't exist five years back but now they are part of our life SAS offerings were not very common now you can find SARS offering for virtually everything right and you could see that the kind of automation that has gone in the kind of Simplicity that has gone in has just made our lives it's eating from the bottom right infrastructure we people used to host on-prem infrastructure now there is cloud that is still have like all of this is still happening the bottom like the what gets eaten up the mundane the repetitive the tedious one gets eaten right so that we find meaningful ways like AWS expert or gcp expert didn't exist but now there are proper certifications for that I need to understand when something goes away something new comes up because humans know how to survive it's our ability right so at the end understand this we all are part of this pyramid we are placed somewhere even we don't know where we are placed and it's just that things will start eating up from the bottom you just have to ensure that you are not at the base of the pyramid that's it that's all you have to ensure that you are constantly adding value doing impactful work and staying not at the bottom of the pyramid that's really important to know so will AI replace programmers let's come to this question given the way the AI is advancing we would definitely see programmer we are seeing programmers becoming more and more and more and more productive and AI becoming smarter we are now seeing how AI can automatically improve our code quality it can help us debug issues it can understand the code that we are writing and all of these things that we as humans were good at doing now ai is helping us it's not replacing us yet it is helping us understand it is spitting out that is this is what this code is doing and our brain is processing what the text that it spit out now the thing is that when it would have its own conscious kind of curtain got Consciousness where it understands what it spit out that's where things would start to change but the thing is that with this the program is becoming more and more efficient we would see companies needing fewer and fewer employees this exact same thing happened with Industrial Revolution where you would have thousands of employees or thousands of workers working in factories got replaced by machines and now there are a bunch of supervisor supervising machines right and that's something very similar would happen with AI creeping it right so when we said will AI replace us now this is where you need to understand where you are drawing the line when we say replace are you talking about partial replacement or complete eradication complete eradication cannot happen overnight it would happen over decades I'm not only saying use it would happen over decades but partial replacement you would start to see you are seeing companies laying off you are seeing companies requiring fewer and fewer people to do that exact same thing 100 people used to require to code a code an e-commerce app now five Engineers needed but you can just use Shopify to host your application right so a lot of these things have already been happening but with AI just got a little more boost you need to understand is that we were already part of this revolution where more and more tools were being created to enable one person companies but now with AI it's just taking it to the next level right that even those one person like the tools that were enabling one person companies are also becoming more and more efficient so which is where you need to understand that complete eradication takes a really long time because we still see carpenters and blacksmiths and still they still exist even after industrial revolution and so much of automation so much of machines right so you need to know that AI is it will eat the world not denying that but you need to know it happens like complete eradication happens for a black it happens over a really long time now now the best part and the worst part is that with us using llms or any AI tool it's becoming smarter by the day now it would start coding things out correctly up until now we see AI is hallucinating giving us stupid answers random stuff here and there but over time they would helps in it lesser they would have improved accuracy and then humans as humans we would be there to verify the correctness of it that's what our job would be exactly what happened with Industrial Revolution when workers were replaced by machines we got new jobs supervisors who supervises machines and ensures that hey temperature is correct this setting is correct machine is doing the job have you seen the blacksmiths now mining the steel and doing this and like moving the Earth here and there to mind stop no it's all machines who are doing it and earlier to move or to dig a hole you needed 50 people like you need a 10 to 15 people working two or three days to dig a big hole now you can do it with the Digger very easily and that's the beauty of it the number of people doing that repetitive mundane word would be far fewer because few are now more you are not more efficient in doing it right so given that as a state what would this person do like what would our job be our job in the immediate sense would always be to ensure correctness because at the end the software is going to power a business you would have customers customer is not interacting with AI and say hey I'm buying a subscription it's interacting with you as a company so it's your responsibility to ensure that you are not screwing up your customer so which is where when something goes down your customer would scold you and you cannot just blame it on air that day AI did it I did not do anything there so which is where you are making money as humans you are the one who are responsible for uptime and correctness and whatnot so similar to how we have supervisors we would have something similar over here and I'm just over simplifying it you would still need coders you would still need Engineers who can engineer stuff but you'd require far fewer of them and but then this means that when something is taken out a new set of jobs a new set of domains a new set of things would come up and we still don't know what that would be but we would figure it out anyway right okay so performance correctness confirmness to establish design all of this like we have to take care of like there is no no denying this but always I'm iterating it one more time that this will not happen overnight so stop being paranoid about it eradicating something takes a really long time replacing an entire job family like Engineers like software developers and programmers it's a huge thing and it cannot just happen in a thinosis snap don't worry about it right so from this it's important to know to know that programmers are Engineers are becoming more efficient but coding you ask any seasoned engineer they would say coding is just 10 percent ninety percent of my day goes into understanding understanding users understanding product understanding design breaking out the like basically breaking down the tasks doing stakeholder management and velocity tracking and so much and so more right because at the end humans are working with humans AI is an aid at the moment so what's immediate in the future that we would become more efficient and we would be required to generate substantial amount of output as part of our work but don't worry about eradication so soon it's okay right but always understand every time every single job over time maybe decades maybe centuries it will eradicate right but do we want to be paranoid about it not really we would always find different Avenues to do meaningful job the meaning would change but if you are still yet to figure out what that meaningful job would be so should you worry should you worry yes you should but to what degree you definitely don't want to be paranoid about it that hey nowadays my job is gone like eventually I will eat that up so I won't do anything it's easy to daydream it's easy to create conspiracy theories around it and to live in our own little sweet world but the reality is different overnight eradication will not happen so understand this where you should where you should put your energy into so understand this that the eating up will always happen from bottom to top you have to ensure you are not at the bottom you have to ensure the work that the work that you are doing is Meaningful is impactful no matter what so here are few things that you should do and just one thing understand is we are in the middle of AI Revolution just like how people back in 1980s or rather basically basically back in 70s or 1700s where the Industrial Revolution happened what happened is the people the workers who were doing that manual thing got scared we are getting scared in a very similar fashion we are fortunate to be living in this space where this transition is happening we don't know what lies in the future right but we definitely know it's going to be exciting it's going to be very interesting to see how things transpire but here are few things that you should do first of all upskill you would hear this term a lot but what does upskill mean in this age it given the stage of your career upskilling would mean different things to you an early engineer might want to explore programming AI understanding deep learning and whatnot a seasoned folk might might want to become specialist in the domain that ever that they are working on currently because it's hard to switch domain after a very long time that you spend in your career right and when we say that you have to create impact what does this mean you have to look beyond the framework you have to look that hey okay it's no it's okay that I know a framework but I tell you have to be a problem solver but it's not about the language it's not about a framework it's about you knowing given a problem how to solve it because that's when you would be able to bring quick output and outcomes for your organization you but you definitely have to be really good at something domain specialization will be really important in the future right now generalists still strive their domain specialization having expertise in something would be required but while having a generalist mindset that you can switch domains if required and building an ability to to tackle tougher problems is I feel would be the life universe and everything because if you cannot solve tougher problems because easy problems are solved by AI tougher problems you would have to right so building an ability building a knack to tackle tough problems head on will be really important now becoming an engineer not a not just a developer see there's a huge difference between an engineer and a developer a lot of people disagree to that but engineer is someone who would dive deep into stock and can switch domains if required developer is just about developing applications there is a slight intersection between the two but think of the mindset think of a mindset of a problem solver solve problems tackle hard problems that's really important and try to be better or make yourself better every single day that would be really essential the world will become hyper competitive and I'm not at all denying this this future seems scary the intention was not to scare you all off the intention was to ensure that no one has their eyes closed to what's happening around thinking hey we are safe because I work at Frank I am safe no not at all it's a because you are there to bring an impact you are safe you have to ensure that you are not at the bottom at the bottom of the pyramid you are slightly above because when the eating happens then layer by layer it would start trimming off and it would happen eventually and it's not I'm talking about overnight and I'm again reiterating it's not overnight that the entire job industry would be switched here and there it will take time for us to Do complete eradication you will get breathing space you will get time to get adjusted to something else but keeping an eye open to that is really important so again I do not intend to scare you but it's more about being aware of what's happening around it's extremely important for you to upskill it's extremely important for you to become better engineer every single day who does not just add value through coding at the moment because coding we definitely foresee that coding is going to be kind of eradicated first because it would still required to tell AI what needs to be done so coding is the new mundane so don't just rely on coding think of problem solving a true Problem Solver what I feel would see this as a problem with AI and would try to solve it right so don't be scared be open be optimistic about future think of becoming a better engineer every single day see what's happening around does that mean you'd have to switch domain right away but open open your eyes and stay awake right that's really important for you to know what's happening what's not you just cannot live in your own bubble and yeah it might it I'm I apologize if I would have scared you but this is what I think of what AI would be this is what I think how our words would pan or how our world would pan out post AGI but as Engineers we don't know if the same domain like obviously Industries evolved we have seen a huge growth in our industry in just mere 30 40 years we have seen tremendous growth and the growth of X5 and the growth will exponentially increase right so it's always better to think of yourself as problem solvers and not someone who is stuck to a particular ticket domain and whatnot it's okay like it's better to be specialist in one but having that flexibility to switch is really important and this is what my take is about will AI replaces program so in a gist not anytime soon but be open because we don't know how quickly things advance and think of yourself as a problem solver rather than restricting yourself to a specific topic and yeah that's all what I wanted to talk about in this way right if you found it interesting give this video a thumbs up if you guys like the channel give
