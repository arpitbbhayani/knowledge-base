so the engineers are supposed to be great at engineering but to have a thriving career and make an impact having only hardcore Tech skills is not enough soft skills play an even important role soft skills is not just about speaking well or writing good emails but they go well beyond that to discuss this in detail we have with the Shashank sir who is an eight-time successful founder and currently running his own Venture fund and an active investor in health Tech edtech e-commerce and Mobility startups basic thank you so much Shashank for doing this it really means a ton uh basically before we jump into the soft skills part of things I would request you to share a quick snippet of your journey over the user oh thank you everybody you're very kind you guys put me on pedestal uh but it's like any other story there are hundreds and thousands of such people and my journey has been you know starting a tech company which was an ISP then starting telecom companies ASP companies which now are called SAS and then I took some time off travel the world then I started working for very large Pharma company because I wanted to have some corporate experience uh you know assistance integration company Tech major as you heard Glacier smithline iqba and on and on and that's what I do I love uh sharing what I've learned and for longest while I used to be consumer of all the media but last two three four years I like very openly sharing so thank you so much for having me that's that's far too many things that you have done in your life I I hope I at least do only 10 percent of yours and I'm more than happy with that I hope that you do 10 times as I do because young people have many more tools now oh yeah thanks thanks so much sir okay so let's uh let's address the biggest elephant in the room soft skills like one like soft skills as like basically according to me soft skills is the worst word that that that primary someone could have assigned to this as soon as you hear the word soft it is oh it's not so important right and which is exactly where the pain Point starts to kick in because people don't give enough importance to that right so uh let's start with this like like what's your key definition of talk skills how do you see soft skills on on what levels and uh how do you weigh them and then we'll jump into each one of them sure so you know you are right in terms of like soft skill kind of have a connotation where it's not as important however if you think about it the other way to put this is soft skill is you must have skills so whether you can do engineering or not but you must have the other skills so for example if you go to a restaurant and you are with your boss or you are with somebody that you know you really put a high regard for you only focus on them do you or also focus on the you know servers to you if server comes and brings a plate to you do you say thank you it's important and those are kind of skills those are basic skills must have skills irrespective whether you are rich or poor whether you are you know an MBA or not an MBA whether you're just starting out or whether you are very very accomplished those kind of skills are What I Call basic skills and I think some people call them soft skills that's an excellent point because this is this is so underrated like like the kind of situation that you put me and I was just thinking like like if I'm so engrossed in the communication and I don't say thank you to the waiter it might sound out it would definitely seem rude God this is interesting okay so let's let's start with the first one uh uh specifically talking with respect to Engineers uh basically one of the most specific things that people say that hey I need to have a problem solving skill now this most ingenious thing that hey it's more of the data structures algorithm system design all of this needs to know is that really the problem solving skills and in general if I were to see it for me problem solving skills is not just knowing the hardcore Tech skills but more about having that right attitude towards that I just want to hear your thoughts on it you absolutely so problem solving is more an attitude rather than a skill so and generally it comes to all of us when we are children so as a childhood your parent will say hey by the way can you help this your younger sibling to do something can you help them tie your shoes right or can you do any task around the house or can you go get something from the market and then when you look at the situation and you figure out what do I need to do or if there is a problem if there is a toy broken do you first Despair and then starts off or you go back to the first principle or how about this bill or do you pick up instruction manual first there are multiple ways to solve this but that kind of builds as to kind of people we are if your parent always said I'm only going to ask you to build this if you have picked up an instruction manual first then you will grow up always picking up the instruction manual first yes if your parents or your teachers have told you this is the problem I don't care how you solve it you go and solve it and you have been the kind of person who always called a friend and say hey I'm on a problem how do I solve it that means you're always a collaborative and team worker if you always went in yourself and try to figure out and if you were failing again and again and you never asked for help that means you're a lone wolf you'd never asked for help you grow up to become a person who doesn't ask for help there are so many ways to look at this and that's where I tell a lot of Engineers and young people that attitude of how you solve a problem any problem can be solved in multiple ways but you should look at what kind of problem requires a single effort what kind of problem requires asking for help what kind of problem requires looking at a instruction manual if you've got a Lego set it's easy pick up the instruction manual and you can pick a Lego set right yeah but if you're picking up an algorithm sometimes if you're stuck and you're getting the same result the best is to ask for help true this is so interesting now now I've started to contemplate my own thoughts like am I a lone wolf because I feel so I am very scared of asking for help and for me it is something that I am right now working on that it's okay to ask for help uh in most cases I tend to be the lone wolf and just just keep grinding it through and now I started to think about my own Journey thanks for that brilliant okay but but this is there are so many Engineers which like and they tend to put it under a blanket saying hey I'm an introvert I won't go and ask for help and this is the and basically according to me this is a very lame excuse of you not having a like you may think that that that primarily you are you are actually you are actually respecting others time but when I put it into the entire context you are not just wasting your time you might be missing out on your project delivery your team velocity is getting affected and what not like people simply think of their own personal output and not teams output and sometimes it's just easy to ask for someone's help to ensure that you meet your deadline eventually that would transfer into your team's success and you become a better engineer overall also you mentioned about introvert right A lot of the time these labels are not designed by our brain they are designed by outside people and if we hear our teachers saying it our parents saying it our society our friends saying it then we accept it that that is what we are and that that is where I always challenge people that I guarantee you can tell me anybody who's labeled as introvert and I can give them a situation where they will absolutely behave the opposite of what the introverts do and you can pick an extrovert and I can put them in a situation where they will never be able to free you that they are extroverted they will become very very cocooned in themselves these labels mean nothing people need to think that our brain is conditioned over time and how do we unlearn from that conditioning is what makes us great most of the people you pick any biography of anybody thinker business person politician you know actors they have not had a linear life at all I haven't seen a single person who's got a new life right I mean most linear people actually don't achieve much anybody who's a child is something that people talk about they have always broken the mold and that's what everybody should think about because everybody can if you take these labels that somebody else of a society has given you and you accept that that is where the point of failure starts that's so interesting because now if I think about it I like I thought I was an introvert like I used to stammer and stutter and now if I go back and think about it like I never give attendance until my master so even even in while I was while I was going for my Master's Degree whenever teacher used to take attendance I never uttered basic presents or present ma'am because I still stutter I was very scared but now here I am talking to you on a podcast which would be put out on the internet and I really cannot believe this and now when I think of it I've I use I even I also use introvert as an excuse but then I started putting myself into those uncomfortable situations and as you rightly said I broke the mold right absolutely sure so point I can one should always put oneself in uncomfortable situations right and that's how you build that attitude like like because when you put yourself into those those those kind of weird situations you basically outgrow yourself and that's the best part the comfort zone is the worst enemy more than anything else yeah oh present so uh next point that uh I'd like to bring about is around humor and smile like what I've seen is uh a lot of people whenever like uh especially when someone joins a new organization right at that point of time what happens is he or she tries to crack a bunch of jokes just to get comfortable uh and worse of all when someone gets comfortable they don't know where to draw the line right so it's it's very easy to offend someone and you you might not even realize right so I have throughout my career obviously we have seen so many people who don't know where to draw that line but for some it's okay for some it's not now here there are like how should someone approach this like in general how uh how can someone know that am I basically crossing the line or not so and then we'll talk about why Uber is important but but before this like this is really the Crux of it where where everyone struggles everyone struggles because you may crack an offensive joke you may because for you it's not for someone else it is now how do you strike that balance so it's uh I always like people with smile I think everybody likes to smile yeah you're traveling in a complete you're meeting a complete stranger if they've got smile you suddenly feel comfortable yes and somebody who's got a non-smiley flat face or an angry face Etc you just kind of like take a step back Etc so smile is very important and humor always is very good humor some people have it again meaning they have the approach of life where they don't take things too seriously and some people won't want to make an effort as you said in a new job you arrive you've got a new team and you want to you know that you know if you crack a joke then maybe you'll make friends and if you make friends then everything else become easy and you're right these days uh you do not know because the diversity of workplace and diversity around in the world is so much that you do not know what might be absolute innocent joke for majority of the people in the room but one or two people in the room might find offensive because it is about their race ethnicity their background you know whatever disability Etc or it might just be bad case for two people because of their own background nothing to do with you or nothing to do with that scenario so one key thing is always make a joke on yourself oh if you do not know where to draw the line right and a lot of people don't know where to draw the line so make a joke on yourself so then if you are crossing the line people will actually not get offended because you're joking on yourself make a joke on your own family make a joke on your own self not on other people not on other people's ethnicity not on somebody something else that might be offensive to that group of people that cohort of people but if you're joking on yourself then people can't really blame you for that right yes yes yes this is such a nice hack and this is this is specifically great during your early strength when you don't know folks when you don't know where to do it so first couple of months crack jokes on your own situation rather than someone else or words about the company but one thing you have to remember if you're new in a situation if you know people then it doesn't matter if you're a group of college friends no problem whatever you do because they know you big enough they're not going to judge you when in a new company I tell people that you know if you're cracking a joke on yourself don't crack a joke in such a way that actually remains your work or your skill because then people will actually take that for granted yeah because they'll think okay if you say I am very bad at something then it will stick with them that you are bad at that so you should try and do that and easy thing is you know stand in front of the mirror and crack a joke and see what happens record yourself and a lot of people this is another hack for people who don't know where to draw the line is I tell them that you know you should record yourself these days everybody's on mobile phones you can record whatever record yourself and then listen back to that and when if you're listening back to it and you don't find it bad taste at all then you were probably halfway there because 95 of the time when you listen to yourself you realize what are you doing wrong and most people just don't do that yeah most people don't recruit themselves but uh that's an excellent thing like earlier we didn't have mobiles we used to basically look at mirrors and basically and basically rehearse speech uh Small Talk set that that we are giving but now we have mobile which which gives us like really good feedback because you can play it all over again rather than you while talking you have to observe what you are saying it just makes your life so simple but while talking you cannot observe while talking because your your brain is functioning in delivering it yes you're not consuming it but recording and listening that is consuming and that is when you realize that oh I said it if somebody else would have said it I would have been offended a bit or they said something about uh you know a city it's a there is a there is always a banter between Bombay and Delhi and London and Paris and Paris and New York and once you say it and record it it's such an easy way to figure it out yeah one one thing that uh uh came up from this is like we like like like primarily having an ability to put ourselves into someone else's shoe is so important because if you cannot think while wearing someone else's shoe then you would never know when to draw that line not just with respect to humor but also with respect to customer and and basically primarily what not but having this like like having this ability to put yourself into someone else's shoe and analyze the situation is so important like across across life absolutely and and the third piece I would say about the hack about the humor and cracking jokes is if you keep the jokes on non-people non-country non-religion Etc but even on others things which are not uh you know in terms of feelings that's much easier so you can make jokes about computers you can make joke about laptops yeah you can make joke about you know mobile phones and without bringing in the things which might be related to Sentiments of people sentiments being empathy empathetic towards sentiments is very very important and now I know why internet is filled with jokes on jeera everyone talks about jira type exactly I mean for me there are there are like I don't know five million jokes about Microsoft there are five million jokes about Google you can you can do all that that's absolutely fine yeah yeah even now I feel even the folks at atlassian don't feel bad about it I I think they all they all find it funny uh yeah with Twitter now these days the memes and the jokes are becoming the easy way to break the ice yes yes fill it okay okay so next up is about effective communication like this is the most common thing that people think when they when they hear the term soft skills it's about you trying to communicate effectively now obviously it depends on what you are trying to communicate and there are basically multiple phases and it's a very broad thing but if if you were to pick like two or three key things in order to deliver something effectively like you are a great speaker no doubt in that but now if if I were to ask you this then what were those three pointers that that you might want to give like that you ensure while you are delivering something that you are effectively communicating what you wanted to so effective communication can come in multiple multiple shapes and form in multiple circumstances and uh you know it's my pet uh word and I think your friend with ankush and sunny as well yeah and whenever they ask a question I say there are two things it depends and it depends on the context right if you're in a work setting uh particularly we are talking about engineering and stuff so in engineering uh if you are working towards a deliverable and you have figured out that it is going to be very tight time then committing that I will deliver on Tuesday when knowing very well that is going to be really really push is that communication but you should say I will try my best for Tuesday it is very tight so we should have a buffer involved when you communicate that then you're in team and you're superiors or people who are dependent stakeholders they all know that you are working towards Tuesday but there is a caveat that it might not happen instead of you taking you thinking in your brain that it actually needs eight hours and guess what I've got this party I have to go to this party this is my friend's wedding I will go there but you know what I'll I'll find two hours and I'll do it and that's how you're putting those eight hours that means you are actually effectively not communicating yeah because all these other things that you are in you know you've you've not factored in something that might be an external thing that might happen to you maybe when you went to the for the wedding you were not able to take two hours right maybe you thought that you're gonna burn the Midnight Oil and that noise something happens with your child and you had to take the child to the college or like your whatever yeah you were not able to find that extra hour so it always depends and it's contextual but effective communication is always trying to be sensible and thoughtful of other people who are dependent on you and that is universal if your parents are dependent on you you have to be thinking about that way if your colleagues are dependent on you you think about that way and then if you think if you start becoming thoughtful of other people who are dependent on you your communication will start improving because now you're not thinking about yourself you're thinking about other people so it's always about understanding the situation really well and then trying to cover almost all possible cases before you you basically try to pitch it nobody can cover all possible places but you know you should think about if I'm not able to deliver what's going to happen is that if the code needs to be you know committed today push tomorrow if I'm not able to commit today the push date is going to be forward which means you have to make sure that product manager is aware that this might not be pushed tomorrow it's just curtsy yeah and people who do these kind of effective communication they are generally the ones which people trust more and more trust yeah yeah and trust is the biggest currency is whether whichever way you work at trust is the biggest currency and more effective communication you do that trust comes to you in absolute loads and more trust fills in more you're able to get better comp more you're able to get better you know appraisals the much faster growth in your career yeah everybody wants to work with you everybody wants to hire you and that's what people should think about I think this is such an interesting perspective where two seemingly unrelated thing trust and communication how they are so much intertwined primarily because like when you are very clear with your communication where you are accepting that it might spill because a lot of people are scared of accepting that and it just builds massive trust that hey it's okay because everyone makes mistakes or maybe due to some unfortunate incident there is a delay but in any case this person is very clear about that there will be delay he or she is not shying away and that builds trust and and and obviously like like this is something when I led a team I expected from my Engineers that in case there is a delay I would not shout there is no problem just communicate it with me because I have to manage other stakeholders right and if and and that's and basically that's the key you just have to ensure and if I were to summarize this like effective communication is all about putting everyone on the same page yeah and so you know my early startups uh building the companies in the 90s late 90s and early 2000s one I had I had one rule for everybody in the team we were doing lots of product bills at a much Breakneck speed absolutely you know they were like any idea and there was somebody assigned and they would have to develop this you know deliver an MVP and then we'll pick up so it was very very fast pace and if you think about it this is pre.com error the internet was new everything seemed to be like the fiction coming reality and we all felt like we were in The Matrix trying to make this section reality everything had to be delivered yesterday and when that happens there's a lot of pressure on all the engineering team because they are you know they are hired thinking they are smart they are paid very well and you put too much pressure on them and I know that as a Founder I know that a lot of times I put on due pressure on them that you must do it you can't go to sleep who cares if you've got this event at your family I don't care I need you to deliver but one thing I used to tell them that always remember bad news must travel faster than the good news so if something is going to fail and you can see it then let me know that I can foresee this failure coming ahead so that I can plan accordingly for example if I have trusted five people to deliver an MVP and I've said to them and I haven't told them anything else but I'm talking to media and I'm saying I'm gonna be this is a press release which should come out on this day if they haven't told me that mvp is not going to be launched my press release goes out everything just falls apart true right true if they had told me two days in advance that this might be delayed all I need to do is pick up a phone and tell my media guys hey guys please delay that press release by two days yeah yeah so and that's true so far for bad news must travel faster than good news that is such a simplistic way to put it God doesn't like for me this is eye-opening I'm learning so much thanks thanks for this is this is brilliant way to put it like bad news should travel faster than good news and that's what is it all boils down to right because people try to put in those extras just to avoid avoid that bad news and that becomes the root of all evil right and if you just keep everyone on the same page and in most cases it is about keeping everyone on the same page for the bad news that's also a ton of problem and that just makes you an effective Communicator yeah nice nice like one thing uh that I had like one buzzword that I've heard a lot a lot is basically being a good Storyteller right now what I've seen is like everyone wants to have good projects everyone wants to innovate everyone wants to work on something humongous now in that case say I have an idea I mean I am a normal engineer I got an idea that hey we all should do something like XYZ pqr I got an idea and I just want to pitch it now when I say pitch it like there is a way like I can view a nice story around it and Pitch it I can just bluntly pitch it because no one wants to sound or like like no one wants to hear to a boring story or a boring page right everyone wants something interesting you want to have them invested in your idea as much as you are right now if like you here pitches every now and then not just from Founders but also while you were leading teams you like what was that thing like what made a pitch a great pitch right with respect to project with respect to company with respect to anything like if if if you were to summarize that SO pitching and storytelling I mean you've probably heard of me uh last two years I've been telling lots and lots of people about my 30 second pages yeah and and there have been books written about it and there are courses about it about storytelling and the movies are made about story movies are about storytelling yeah but in context of work more clarity of thought you have more simplistic way you are able to tell people what is it here that you're talking about and I have a thumb rule it's if it's not pitching an idea particularly you know startup case and the engineering ideas case it should be no more than 30 seconds that you should be able to relay your Prime thought your Prime idea should be conveyable in 30 seconds it should be simple enough that a 10 year old who doesn't know engineering can understand so you can look around your nieces nephews your you know a guy on the street whatever 10 year old kid if the 10 year old kid understands what you're talking about that means that you have got the attention of the 10 year old if you can get an attention of a 10 year old if you can get a Detention of somebody who has not done engineering or MBA or whatever even like somebody who's not who's illiterate for example that means you are now good enough to convey that to The Wider world because what happens is if you're able to convey something in 30 second to a 10 year old that person is interested now and now that person is happy to give you two to five minutes of their time and that two to five years of focused time is when you expand on that idea but the basic idea should be given enough in 30 seconds to buy the two or five minutes so anybody who's pitching the work the project the idea the code a problem you could pitch a problem that you know our code is this but you know what on down the line I can see this problem happening that's a pitching your problem statement to somebody yeah if you're able to convey that in 30 seconds you should always think how can I buy five minutes of their undivided attention and this is all about buying attention because today's world attention deficiency is everywhere not because of any clinical situation it's because we have so much to do in so little time and there's so much of information overload SO pitching is about getting people's attention for two to five minutes undivided and getting them excited by the 30 seconds so what should what should constitute a pitch the problem and the solution or uh maybe a story or what what like like if if if you were to split that 30 second into two or three five into basically two or three fragments what would that be so it could be a problem it could be solution it could be just introducing yourself it could be introducing your company it could be anything it depends and it's contextual and I keep on repeating this again okay let me let me let me add that let me add that let's say I have a product to pitch right now what would you look at in that basic 30 second Pitch okay so if you have a product so either you can pick there are there are five to five seven different types right you can either amplify the problem statement so create a fear in somebody's mind right or you could create a solution with a big enough Target addressable Market or beginner money behind it right so people people like a Honeypot people like the Honeypot or people respond to their fear so you have to figure out what is it that will give that person their attention is this person going to be influenced by my fear story is this going to be influenced by my Honeypot story is this person going to be interested in my my own capability story and that's where you get it so for example if you take politicians most politicians everywhere around the world address people's fear yeah right or or a lot of the politicians also address people's hope so they will say if you choose me the future is going to be that you will never have problem in relation to job search because I'll create so many jobs right so that's a hope scenario in a future scenario somebody will say if you don't choose me the opposition is a divisive person and your community will fail right yeah in the startups case when they go we see the Ninja investors all they say is if you choose me my idea is worth a billion dollars right so you have to think if you if you sell hope or fear yes you either Sell Hope or yourself fear or you sell a potential of becoming but somebody that you always wanted to be either rich or famous or whatever else right in terms of a software project it could be a humongous gain into something exactly so for example um if you think about around the all if you pick 20 random brand names that everybody talks about today a lot of people forget that half of them were built in last 15 years true and people don't think you know we how many people actually think about which is the best brand of bed in your house not many right but if you say name 10 brands and people will start from you know either the one what they wear or what they consume whichever way they consume right yeah and a lot of people just pick up the brands from Apple and Microsoft and Google not realizing Microsoft's the only one which is The Old Company really everybody else like less than 20 years old company hmm so in context of you know pitching particularly for software you can what is the problem it's solving so if you picked up something like you know everybody brushes their teeth in the morning and the toothbrush fails it's it's now starting to becoming a boring story because people don't think it's a big enough problem right yeah if you pick in context social media is becoming trouble for your children I have a solution now you've elevated the people's interests because everybody knows that's a problem everybody knows they're gonna face it everybody wants a solution for it [Music] pretty interesting yeah this is this is so well put because now when I think of all the pitches uh that I have seen or uh I got pitched twice for some reason people think I can invest but yeah but but when I saw them pitching this is exactly how they delivered it like it was either fear or hope and in general they just try to capture my attention in first 30 seconds and that's a brilliant way to put it okay now you do you juggle between far too many things right and now this is one of the most common or rather most most famous buzzword out there time management like if I were to like or if if primarily any engineer any leader anyone would want to do a better time management what would it boil down to because I know you would have a one-line answer for that what is that one thing that someone should focus on to like who uh basically what is that one thing that the entirety of time management boils down to two words yeah I knew it I do it because you asked me what you're gonna do it in short so I have to do it in short and again I'm proposing 30 seconds for two words you should always ask yourself whatever you're doing or what am I doing this for right if you ask this question for what again and again and again and you embed that as your you know thought process as your psyche you will start dropping things that are not important and time management is more about dropping things that are not important than doing things that are important because if you drop things that are not important automatically you will focus on things that are important and if you focus on things that are important your time module will become easy uh I mean when you are young it is very cool to say I am very busy when you're older it is cool to say I have a lot of time yeah yeah certainly so because our entire life we acquire things we acquired fame or wealth or whatever because we want to be able to do what we really want to do but if you start by trying to do what you really want to do more likely you will have a much more balanced and happier life 100 it's so well for what for what every before everything that we pick for what if it's worth it do it yeah many times we pick up you know things because they make us happy and that's absolutely okay yeah but a lot of the times we pick things because our family told us because our teachers told us because our boss told us because it is what everybody else is doing rather than realizing it doesn't make me happy so what's the point um for what I'll I'll that's it that's a that's a brilliant way to put it forward like like just just asking this one critical question and it's also a ton of problem for what no no need to do it what's urgent what's important this and that for what it just boils down to this no no need to have a four damage still thinking needed for this just ask for what be brilliant but when the answers come back right for what you will get sometimes vague answers but more you ask the questions you will realize your own four or five parameters of how you judge things yes so you will realize am I doing it for money am I doing it for fame am I doing it to please somebody else am I doing it because it brings happiness to me and then over a period of two years three years you'll realize what are the things you would prioritize and you will automatically then it'll become an automatic thing that you know uh whenever something comes in you will give the right answer because your forward has already you know uh you are actually sorted in your head already yeah yeah yeah yeah nice this is really good and now while I'm talking to you I am actually thinking for what well what am I talking to you that's the question yeah exactly but I know I'll tell you I mean I'll tell you mine for what for doing this with you first I like you as a person I've heard you a few times right I like you as a person second for what is that I realize that your uh your internal inherent desire is always to help people yeah and I thought if he's helping people and if this is going this conversation is going to help more people that's my forward for this uh and another third for what for me is to have a we've talked very randomly very short period of time this was my one way of getting one hour with you so that's my three four words thank you so much it's like I trust me I've learned so much from you just just by observing how you operate and like entertainment now this this one our time is is basically worth its weighted gold for me like I've learned so much just when you stick to you for me okay okay so one thing that I always believed like you you actually brought up the topic where I like to help people and one thing that when I led teams to to primarily whatever capacity I could uh I realized that when I help others succeed which is when I succeed right but if I'm just helping others uh selflessly right and it might not transfer to be something substantial for me always because there are always people who might rob us right in like in primary which ever since we may want to take it now helping others is really critical now let's first focus on the positive part of it like I always believe helping others succeed is my way to contributing in their Journey number one second my way to be a little more selfless this way I would put my team first my organization first if I'm always being very selfish I would not look at it like I would just think hey am I growing am I growing I and I would just skip doing all the mundane things right because but sometimes you have to do the mundane things to to to establish yourself right because no one else is doing why not you so that's my way to look at it like helping others helping teams succeed helping others succeed helping the community succeed helping teams succeed helping organization succeed like what's your take on health others helping others is what we do all the time we are we are social animals right we 300 000 years ago we evolved from you know Serengeti and we've around the world if you think about it what is one thing that I ask people what do you what is one thing that you do which is not helping others and people might say things like okay I sleep I eat etc etc but you know everything else that we do socially is always about helping others whether we're growing up we are helping our parents do the task controls and our parents do that they force us you're gonna get your pocket money if you do this if you go to school and if you finish your homework on time this is your reward and somehow starting from parents then school then our friends the general Society there is a study done uh and I can't find the name of it right now but after this I'll probably send you a link you can put it in the podcast I'll do that that the dopamine effect which gives you pleasure the highest form of dopamine is when you help others with clear knowledge that you will gain nothing in back that gives you the highest dopamine that is why people psychologically not knowingly help other people if you are standing at the corner of a road and there is a child or there is an elderly person struggling to cross the road it is our instinct to go and help that person cross the road because we know that our brain will give us a happiness Factor so much that we can't get by even eating a chocolate for example there is a whole psychological study about it that helping others when knowing that nothing is going to be coming back makes you so much happier and that's why we help others maybe during younger days you are a little more selfish but as you grow older as you grow wiser if I may put it you are you you basically tend to help others more that's what I've observed it might be completely wrong help more when I grow older that's what is because I've seen my father do a lot more charity than than what he did when he was younger my grandfather do even more foreign of the world then we are more like hey I need this I need money I need to do this you become a little more selfish but but I like I may look at it as uh as a normal distribution where you are very selfless at first you are very selfless at the latest stage of your life but you you might see a peak of you being very selfish I don't think it's a selfish I I know it I I think the other way around it's not selfish when we are dependent on our parents and our teachers right so we don't have to fend for ourselves because they are fending for us we normally help everybody so children help each other yeah all the time they will have some competitive streak Etc but they will help each other when you become independent when you're Adolescent and you are trusted for you to make your own decisions when you are trusted to make decisions for yourself your brain's primary function is to protect you right our brain's primary function is to protect us so not selfish as such unless there is a selfish Act a lot of people do selfish acts as well but generally it is your brain trying to say you know what your time your money your knowledge you protect it because if you're gonna share your knowledge with other students in your college guess what you might not get that you might not be ahead compared to them right so you're not being selfish against them you are being protective of yourself that's a better word yeah yeah that's what I had to convey got it clear communication I'll do that so exactly so it is majority of the time majority of the people who we think in society are selfish you're doing unkind things if you scratch the surface they don't even know that they are being unkind yeah they're just being protected of themselves in a in a slightly non-empathetic way yeah yeah right yeah so maybe there was nobody around them to tell them that hey you can be empathetic and still protect yourself if you have to say no to somebody if somebody asks you in college hey can I share your notes and you want to say no because you know that that person is very competitive and you will get they will get their competitive advantage and you want to say no nobody taught them how to say no politely yeah yeah so you have you can say no by being kind you can share and think that you know sharing notes of your college is not the end game end game is somewhere else in life because college degree is a piece of paper when you're 50 year old that will become so meaningless actually when you're even 40 year old 30 year old that piece of paper is only good for you to get to the job interview yes people don't realize that college degree is only worth you to get inside the interview room yeah once you're inside the interview room that degree means nothing 100 yeah now now when I think of it even during college time I never saw anyone else as my competition never like for some reason a lot of my peers never shared notes because of this exact same reason but I used to spend hours helping them understand the concepts that I knew better right and I was just like that from the beginning because at and actually one more thing for that is while at school I I barely passed my examinations so I had no fear because I knew I just had to pass things right right and that same attitude like my attitude has always been towards loading always for some reason like me learning new things and helping people learn stuff right and that's no and now that I think that when I was so selfless but because I was explaining stuff my understanding became much better in that subject and that's what helped me answer some really difficult questions that I was asking interview Maybe real world scenarios like you just said something I was gonna say I don't interrupt you continue your thoughts so so uh there is the adult learning pyramid right and if you look about it anybody can Google it uh while by listening what do you retain versus reading what you retain being taught what you retain and when you teach what you retain the highest retention of knowledge is when you teach it that is why most knowledgeable people are in the world are the teachers yeah yeah right and I think your mind may have unknowingly cracked this very early on in your life that I a you have an insatiable desire to learn it must happen in people right so if you have that insatiable desire to learn you realize that if I'm teaching somebody if I'm helping somebody I'm learning better yeah if you are saying the same concept to three people those three people are asking you three questions so now you have four questions that your brain has asked rather than three one only if you have only talked about yourself if you have only done it yourself and a lot of people don't realize it that if you want to learn faster start teaching yeah and this is where education technology if you think about people say Ed Tech majority of the edtechs in the world are only about teaching they are not Reinventing the curriculum they are not Reinventing the subject they're not Reinventing I think it's all they are doing is self-paced in teaching by a peer-to-peer or one to many integration they are becoming a platform to interconnect two sets of the prop like Supply and the demand Andrew a lot of people are not realizing that a lot of people who are teaching on these platforms are getting better and better at that skill if they have understood the technique that I am going to go there not just repeat what I've learned as deliverable but I'm going to take the feedback and then improve on it incrementally and then go back and deliver people who will take this kind of feedback continuously and improve incrementally again and again and again they will become experts in those fields if you think about companies like you know Google and deepmind and others and a lot of the AI conversation that is happening right now a lot of people who are working in machine learning and AI right now all they have to do to the machine is to ask better questions or whatever question is asked learn based on that so that your follow-on question answer is better quality than the previous one um and that's exactly what we are used to like so and to be really honest like when I started my cohort course that's exactly like I what I delivered in my first code and now I am at my 16th cohort what I delivered today there is humongous difference and my notes have evolved the where deliver has evolved the way I basically cover the depth Festival because I was open to learning I made mistakes in my first cohort the kind of questions that people asked helped me revise my materials and it became so good over time and like and I love doing it I love when people ask me questions because it just rewires my brain it just basically and it helps me unlearn more than learning right and that's what actually for me it basically matters the most when I when I have some belief in my head which I can just get rid of because it was wrong and and I was and and I was not aware of that that it is wrong it's the best feeling that I get yeah I I unlearned something and now I'm like relearning that stuff and nice you know one one thing you could do as you said you're on the 16th cohort now so go back to the students of the fifth sixth and seventh cohort and ask if any one of them is happy to take your 17th cohort again I'll do that I'll do that I'll do that I'll definitely do that because I personally believe I've changed a lot during this entire duration the way I cover things the kind of depth and and it's just that I have more clarity because what I've observed is for me I ask basic feedback after every session what I got every time like uh in my recent cohorts uh the kind of feedback that I got is people write this they say that I had some questions but you already answered it in the next slide which means that I can put like basic kind of I over the duration the kind of questions that folks from fifth sixth seventh cohort ask it helped me revise the material which is now Auto answering the questions that the folks who are part of my 16th Court have and it's just that I'm I'm basically learning it better like I'm basically covering it all without having a need for them to ask questions but obviously there are new set of questions that are there and they are very different from what questions that were asked in my previous course excellent and the world of AI right now is actually doing that we are all being now trying a bunch of prompts chat GPT per se that how can I ask better questions to and it is very evident that when we ask better questions to AI it is giving us better answers if we ask stupid questions we get stupid answers absolutely there are tons of groups set up around the world right now and believe it or not people are charging to tell you to write better prompts to charity [Music] I mean you business model exactly when people used to say you everybody's heard we don't know what is the job of 2050 right hmm so who would have known in 2020 not 22 000 not 20 years ago but two years ago two years ago yeah yeah not two it's not even two six months ago who would have thought six months ago that there is a job where if you are a good if you have skill to ask better question then you can sit in your garage open a web page and ask people say pay me 50 and I will tell you better questions to ask to chat GPT that job did not exist six months ago right yeah so by blowing to think even about it yeah it's all about asking questions now nice interesting okay if we spoke like we basically digressed of it but it's fight we had Fab conversation now let me come back to the new things like given that uh like we spoke about world is changing everyone needs to adapt now this becomes the biggest like it becomes one of the most important soft skills that one must have like not being rigid to a certain ideology to a certain concept to a certain tool framework like in you being a little more flexible for you to survive because world is extremely fast paced extremely fast like you just said six months ago no one imagined this kind of job would exist or something that would give you handsome amount of money and now here we are in the world of AI right here we are with the world of basically all the charge deputies and lambdas and whatnot so things are evolving we need to keep ourselves adaptable like how like like how should we approach this as simple as that what adaptability is one of the most important thing because change is the constant whether you're looking at change in our uh Society whether we are looking at the way we learn the way we teach way we consume we consume data the way we interact with people all this is changing constantly and if you if you think about it I I mentioned it to somebody yesterday that for somebody who's 80 year old which is basically my parents for them so many science fiction things have become reality it's not funny right for them having a mobile phone was science fiction as a child for him for them having a television was a science fiction uh having you know internet is science fiction wirelessly charging your phone absolute science fiction absolute science fiction yeah right um converting electric converting sunlight to electricity is science fiction Wi-Fi is science fiction uh and it's just 80 years in the last 80 years exactly yeah yeah so I mean there are having carrying a laptop with you is a science fiction uh ability to sit in one airport and 13 hours later arriving in a completely different continent different city different Etc semi-science fiction uh their life has been completely turned from when they were children versus today and that time technology was not fast enough right imagine the children from today the technology is fast cloud computing exists when these people are 50 year old amount of change that might happen is caring right true true so if you're not adaptable that means you're setting yourself for failure so you should always always always be fluid in the way you think what you believe in you should not believe something with permanence I think because when people under something with permanence that means you're conditioning yourself to not unlearn something [Music] so in coding for example if you think the logic way to deliver a certain piece of code is the right way to do it then you are slightly wrong because there is no right way what is Right Way is based on your limitations of thinking today but tomorrow I mean for example 10 years ago who would have thought the service serverless architecture and no code no code programming was possible yeah right my children today they can create games video games by drag and drop true if I'm not open that there will be something even better than this if they are not open that tomorrow there could be even better where they can just think and their thought process can actually create a game if they don't think that's possible then they're setting themselves a failure what they should think is If today I'm able to type something and drag and drop with my mouse How can I convert his Wi-Fi is possible to transfer data from my laptop or from my mobile my modem router to my mobile phone that means there is a wavelength which is transferring from the in the in the air there's a wavelength which is converting that data and transferring to a receptor so how can it not be possible that my brain can generate that wavelength and the person opposite or the device in front of me can become a receptor of that wavelength and deliver a command neuralink I mean technically yeah yeah and there is enough scriptures and there is enough science fiction stories to say that that is possible yeah 100 plus 100 percent I in terms of your point you know original point about adapting to change we should have an open mind that possibilities are endless and if possibilities are endless then I should be absolutely fluid to accept the change adapting a new tech stack adapting to a new environment my current team might be non-diverse but tomorrow my team might be very diverse now I'll give you an example for example for in this context in London if you go on a board meeting in a random board meeting which has 10 people it is very likely that you will have four or more nationalities sitting on the table right um if you have more nationalities or five ethnically diverse people in a ward of 10 people of course they will bring ideas which are different to each other and if you're willing to accept diverse opinions then you know that you're on for better things your company is going to be better your organization is going to be better your Tech stack is going to be better your code is going to be better yeah if you're able to think like a Frenchman an American and a British an Indian and a Japanese and a Korean and a Chinese of course because they think differently they have different experiences from background they have different language they have different ways to solve a problem so if you're talking to five different way people and you're accepting this diversity [Music] I'm back I knew it was gonna happen because your your screen had Frozen for last 15 minutes and I thought oh that's kind of like just disconnected anyways I know that we are going uh longer so I'm going to cut it short um that's that's the you know you have to always be adaptable because that's the only way you'll find solutions that you didn't think was true true being being adaptable especially in this day and age extremely critical but just like in order to know how to do it is it like according to it's all about having that having that desire to unlearn and relearn you having a willingness to put in that effort in order to do it like like if the world is going towards here and you are not willing to put in an effort to learn AI That's your rigidity because of which you are basically setting yourself up for a failure right thanks thanks so much exactly and and I I tell people that you don't have to learn everything this is going back to your time management you have to figure out what do you need to say no if you are a developer who is very proficient in one kind of tech stack you should try and focus that can I become an expert in this I don't have to learn every technology nobody can right you don't have to think okay if as long as you understand the basic concepts and you are focused on one that's great if somebody says I'm a cloud engineer and I can do irrespective whether you are you're a Google cloud or AWS or Azure I can do everything I would rather not that choose that person compared to somebody says what is your stack if your stack is Google Cloud you know what I'm an expert and I've been doing it for five seven years and I know everything because I spend four hours learning about it every week and I unlearn things that I don't you know that I don't that are not relevant anymore yeah yeah so all kind of permutations is it yeah I I just want to end on this high note of adaptability I know we we had few other points to cover but this is so so good we just always end on a high but this adaptability point on how world is so fast moving and especially the rate of change is increasing and which is which is what should make people fall in love with being adaptable should be like should make people be open to unlearn and relearn right thanks thanks so much sir I I just want to stop here because this is on a such a high note that that we are ending and I just want to respect your time as well on that but I thank you so much sir for doing this I it was really eye-opening for me I learned so much irrespective and I'm sure everyone else who would listen to this would love it all right I'll try my best to write as catchy of a social media post as I can while posting it I want folks to listen to this sure thanks so much perfect thank you so much you're very kind you're very generous with your words but thank you thank you thanks so much for doing this
