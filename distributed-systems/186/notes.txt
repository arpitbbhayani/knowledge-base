FloodMax Algorithm for Leader Election

Flood Max algorithm for leader Election leader Election is automated an way of system Recovery . When the leader node is down the leader Election , algorithm is triggered which elects the new leader thus restoring the system Diameter network of a Diameter network the maximum of a is Max ( dci ,j ) fi ,j ) distance between two nodes in the network The Flood Max Algorithm Flood Max works with network algorithm a connected that is arbitrarily Ring topology not enforced node is UID Every given a comparable that may be randomly allotted , and node knows the diameter the every of network .

The algorithm Flood Max selects the node with Max UID to be the new leader and the core idea is the network with the Flooding Max UID . Election happens across multiple rounds diameter network number of rounds = of its In each round , including own node keeps track of Max UID seen so far every and it broadcasts the Max to all the nodes connected to it Thus every round , every node will receive 9 the its have > neighbours u Max seen . v 16 ^ ' ' and after diameter number rounds of , + 18 r 7 we would be sure the message from node a 3 > with Max UID would have reached ^ everyone < . 2 > ' ' " thus , after diameter round , each node knows < Uid seen leader if self = = Max _ aid ! seen leader if self non = Max - hence knows it is the leader Every node if or not

Complexity Analysis It takes 01 diameter ) number rounds to elect the leader of . The number 01 diameter I F- 1) messages exchanged is of number directed the network IEI = of edges in Reducing communication complexity To decrease the number exchanged of messages during election , nodes can send the Max UID only when it changes . This would significantly reduce the messages exchanged across the network Another approach to reduce the communication 7 9 is to NOT send the Max UID in the messages 9 a I the direction of neighbour from which it was z g received send Max UID 9 in l all direction except in the direction of node 9
