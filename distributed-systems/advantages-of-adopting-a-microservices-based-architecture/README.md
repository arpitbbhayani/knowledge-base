Advantages of adopting a microservices-based architecture
===


Why Microservices?ü§î [ in a gist ]

Microservices are small, autonomous, harmonic subsystems that work together to solve the bigger problem.

The core idea of microservices is Divide and Conquer. We break the big problem into smaller sub-problems, and solve each of the sub-problem optimally, enabling us to solve the bigger problem well.

Why Microservices?

‚ö° Codebase grows over time

The product evolves and new features are added to it and that bloats up the codebase. It becomes difficult for multiple teams to coordinate and collaborate on a humungous codebase. One team breaking one module can take down the entire product.

‚ö° Scaling is predictable

With microservices, scalability becomes predictable; you can linearly amplify the infrastructure requirements of individual microservices and be predictable in handling the load.

‚ö° Teams become autonomous

With each team responsible for a set of microservices they can take charge of their tech stack and design decisions. These decisions will be best for their problem statement and can ensure that they are solving them the best way possible.

‚ö° Fault Tolerance

If one microservice is down, it may lead to a partial outage of the product affecting a small fragment of the systems; while other components remain unaffected and can continue to service the traffic.

‚ö° Upgrades are simpler

So long as a microservice adheres to the API contract, the team that owns it can upgrade the tech stack, architecture, and DB seamlessly.


Microservices are great, and the overall microservices-based architecture has some key advantages. In this video, we talk about what are microservices, the key advantages of using a microservices-based architecture, and understand how to fence service and define its set of responsibilities.

# Arpit's System Design Masterclass

> A masterclass that helps you become great at designing _scalable_, _fault-tolerant_, and _highly available_ systems.

## The Program

This is a prime and intermediate-level cohort-based course aimed at providing an exclusive and crisp learning experience. The program will cover most of the topics under System Design and Software Architecture including but not limited to - _Architecting Social Networks_, _Building Storage Engines_ and, _Designing High Throughput Systems_.

The program will have a blend of Live Classes happening on Weekends, and 1:1 Mentorship sessions. The program is designed to be intense and crisp to accelerate the overall learning. We tackle every system from the [First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) and build the solid foundation to architect any system in the future.


## Highlights

 - The course has been taken up by __500+__ people, spanning __9__ countries.
 - People from companies like Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Yelp, Github, Flipkart, Practo, Grab, PayPal, and many more, have taken up this course.


## Hi, I'm Arpit Bhayani üëã

<img width="256px" src="https://arpitbhayani.me/static/img/arpit.jpg" />

In my last **~10** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like _Search_, _Notification_, _Logging_, _Deployment Engine_, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

I also run a YouTube channel [#AsliEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani) where I post 3 videos every week spanning topics like System Design, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and any interesting CS concept in general.

You can find details about upcoming cohort üëá‚Äç Hope to see you soon there.
