FloodSet Algorithm for Distributed Consensus

Flood Set Algorithm : Distributed Consensus Reaching is extremely important consensus in $1000 distributed network any . eg : we cannot have two data nodes in a cluster such that one thinks price = $1000 while the other thinks price = $2000 El the Depending on which node the request hits , user would see the value inconsistent view corresponding , giving an somehow the nodes need to value agree on one . . Achieving distributed consensus is easy when No failures - - is impossible when network unreliable - and tricky when unreliable process a Problem statement complete n - node graph All nodes / processes start with some value V faulty - V E . All non - nodes / processes are agree to required to one un EV or use default to

1 . No two processes decide on different values either Un or default Vo 2 . if all processes start with V EV then they decide on 0 not to some other value converging 3. all non - faulty processes eventually decides FloodSet Algorithm Core Idea keep track the values : of all seen so far W and use some decision rule at the end to pick one . Every node maintains a set W that would hold all the values seen far W E V - so . W if we assume at Max f nodes would fail , then W the Flood set algorithm runs for f -11 rounds chances giving for f processes to tail . After ft L rounds , the processes that survive decides the same value .

Every node will start with W = { it } value that it holds and starts with In each around node broadcasts W in the network every . , When a node receives W from others , it up dats its own W by doing a set union . node i will have all After f- + 1 rounds . every possible values from the other nodes Every node then decides contains element pick that on if its w 1 , if its elements pick W contains > L , default to if all nodes start with the same value . V be sent only v will across and rounds at all nodes W= { } after ft 1 o hence , everyone decides on = v

Alternative decision strategy Depending on the use case , we may choose any decision strategy / d. pick the smallest one " "" 9 as we have total ordering 2. pick the newest one the values of $1000 , 9:00:00 am < Total ordering on timestamp $ 2000 , 9:00:01 am the latest nodes deciding on one < $1500 , 9:00:02am Complexity Analysis Flood Set requires f -11 rounds and in each round its W to every node sends every other node communication Complexity = 0 ( ( ft / In 2)
