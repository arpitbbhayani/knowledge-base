TimeSlice algorithm for Leader Election in Distributed Systems
===


Leader Election is a critical component in any distributed system. It enables the system to auto-recover from leader failures. When a leader node goes down, the Leader Election algorithm is triggered to elect the new leader.

## TimeSlice Algorithm

TimeSlice algorithm for leader election is highly impractical, unbounded, yet an interesting algorithm to understand.

The algorithm assumes

- each node has a UID that is a positive integer
- the nodes are arranged in a virtual ring
- each node knows its immediate neighbor to the right
- each node knows the total number of nodes `n` in the network

### The flow

The election proceeds in phases 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each phase consists of `n` rounds. Because the algorithm is synchronous, each node knows when the algorithm is proceeding with rounds and phases.

In phase `i`, nodes can only forward the message having the candidature of UID `i`. Hence, in phase `3`, a node will forward the message to the next node, only when it is having the candidature of UID `3`.

## The flow

In phase 1, the node with UID 1 will send the message with its candidature across to the next node in the ring. If no such node exists, then no message is sent.

Thus, for `n` rounds within phase 1 there is void silence in the network. Then beings the phase 2.

Hence, we see that the messages will be sent across the ring only when the phase `i` beings where `i` is the smallest UID in the network. For all `(i - i) * n` rounds, there will be void silence in the network.

When phase `i` begins the node with UID `i` will know that it is the new leader and it initiates the message and sends it to the next neighbor. For `n` successive rounds, the message is sent across the network and thus all `n` nodes know about the new leader `i`.

## Complexity Analysis

The algorithm thus elects the node with the minimum UID as the new leader in just `O(n)` messages but takes time proportional to the `O(n*i)`.

If the minimum UID is a large integer, then the algorithm will take a longer time to elect the leader, and hence it is unbounded on the number of nodes in the network.

Leader Election helps our Distributed Systems auto recover without any human intervention and makes the system autonomous.

In this video, we take a detailed look into a Leader Election algorithm called TimeSlice that is extremely impractical but it still provides us great insight into a seemingly weird implementation.

# Arpit's System Design Masterclass

> A masterclass that helps you become great at designing _scalable_, _fault-tolerant_, and _highly available_ systems.

## The Program

This is a prime and intermediate-level cohort-based course aimed at providing an exclusive and crisp learning experience. The program will cover most of the topics under System Design and Software Architecture including but not limited to - _Architecting Social Networks_, _Building Storage Engines_ and, _Designing High Throughput Systems_.

The program will have a blend of Live Classes happening on Weekends, and 1:1 Mentorship sessions. The program is designed to be intense and crisp to accelerate the overall learning. We tackle every system from the [First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) and build the solid foundation to architect any system in the future.


## Highlights

 - The course has been taken up by __500+__ people, spanning __9__ countries.
 - People from companies like Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Yelp, Github, Flipkart, Practo, Grab, PayPal, and many more, have taken up this course.


## Hi, I'm Arpit Bhayani üëã

<img width="256px" src="https://arpitbhayani.me/static/img/arpit.jpg" />

In my last **~10** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like _Search_, _Notification_, _Logging_, _Deployment Engine_, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

I also run a YouTube channel [#AsliEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani) where I post 3 videos every week spanning topics like System Design, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and any interesting CS concept in general.

You can find details about upcoming cohort üëá‚Äç Hope to see you soon there.
