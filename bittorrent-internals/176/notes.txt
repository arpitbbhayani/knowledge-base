Introduction to BitTorrent

Introduction to BitTorrent BitTorrent is a peer - to - peer protocol that distribution makes of large files 1. easier 2. faster 3- efficient classic Download & need of BitTorrent client requests for the file from the REA a server < and the server server , responds . Things client become FILE interesting when there are large number clients download of or a larger file to * Server 's bandwidth is limited , so . more clients will slow things down * speed of data transfer limited by the upload is capacity 60 Mbps if user B 's upload speed is , > < then matter the download speed A no of B A the overall download speed cannot go beyond 60 Mbps . Can we do better ?

Peer to Peer Networks equal peers , Each party has the same capabilities , and can initiate conversation with other . robustness Key highlight of P2P : even if you remove one node from the network , there would not be the any impact on service . No single point of failure ! There also may be a central entity to provide some functionalities The nodes still and * peer are equal would still communicate with each other directly But be provided by some info can the central entity . Note : the network and its services will be affected when the central entity goes down . Hence , this setup is more vulnerable to failures .

Core idea BitTorrent of Download the file from multiple machines , concurrently faster downloads b/w > load is distributed r upload peers > < better utilization of download capacity r > < , 100 Mbps download 60 Mbps upload little extra load large number of down loaders would put only a breaking file into smaller chunks would boost concurrency simplified download flow j L when a user wants to download a file . it around the network to find 7 sniff 's r peers having pieces of it . User then downloads different pieces from different users concurrently faster download and better utilization of download capacity

Nomenclature and Terminologies These would come in handy when we deep dive into algorithms 1. Pieces and Blocks A that shared in the BitTorrent file is L v > network is split into pieces and each into blocks piece is further split " piece transfer > In one , a block is transferred > 4 but > block a piece is served by a peer . * a piece cannot be served if any of the blocks is missing 2. Peer Set A B of peers that > Each peer maintains a list , r it send to and this is called can pieces " its set peer peer set (A) = { C , E } c D peer set (E) = { A , B, C }

3. Active Peer Set A B A peer send data to subset can only a r ' > > r of its peer set and this is called an F- active peer set . " i " active peer set (A) = { c} a D active peer set (E) = { A , B } 4. Seeders and leechers leeches A A peer can be a seeder or a leeches downloading a leeches : when a peer is seeder : when a peer has all the pieces of the content seeder B large number of seeders would lead to a faster download speed , as we can pull from multiple seeders quickly . if teachers >> seeders , download speed ceeould take a hit .

BitTorrent is popular friendly The lot hence new and popular files will have a of seeders , it downloaded faster Old will have would be . or unpopular files few seeders , hence a slower download . Applications of BitTorrent 1. Downloading Linux Distributions faster than FTP and HTTP and large software , movies , games etc, 2. Sending patches to users leg : security patches ) 3. Facebook uses this to power their massive deployments deploying artifacts across servers
