    "gist": "A torrent file is an independent session of transfer. To distribute a file, say Ubuntu, image we would create a torrent holding the meta information about it while the actual content is split into pieces and distributed in the network.\n\n## Lifecycle of a Torrent\n\nTorrent is alive so long as there is at least a seeder, seeding the pieces in the network. Once all the nodes who can share the pieces have left the network, the download of the network stops and the torrent ends until a new seeder pops up.\n\n## What torrent file holds\n\nThe `.torrent` file holds all critical meta yet static information about the content, like\n\n- `announce` - holds the URL of the tracker\n- `created by` - name and version of the program who created it\n- `creation date` - time at which the torrent was created\n- `encoding` - encoding of the strings in `info` dictionary\n- `comment` - some additional comments\n- `info` - a dictionary that describes files in the torrent\n\nThe `info` dictionary holds the information about the file that is being shared through the torrent. If the torrent is about the Ubuntu image, it will hold info like `name`, `length`, and `md5sum` of the actual file.\n\nGiven that the file is split into equal-length pieces, the `info` dictionary also holds\n\n- `pieces` - SHA1 of every piece of the file concatenated\n- `piece length` - number of bytes in each piece\n\nThis information is used in identifying and fetching pieces from the network.\n\n## Bencoding\n\nTorrent files are encoded with a custom encoding called Bencoding. It supports data types such as Strings, Integers, List, and Dictionaries (can only hold string keys).\n\nStrings are encoded as `<length>:<string>`. Hence, a string `arpit` will be encoded as `5:arpit`.\n\nIntegers are encoded as `i<integer>e`. Hence, an integer `10` will be encoded as `i10e`.\n\nLists are encoded as `l<becoded values>e`. Hence, the list `[\"a\",\"b\", 1 ]` will be encoded as `l1:a1:bi1e1`.\n\nDictionaries are encoded as `d<key1><value1><key2><value2>e`. Hence, a dictionary `{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}` will be encoded as `d1:ai1e1:bi2ee`.",
