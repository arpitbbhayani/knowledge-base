How Instagram efficiently serves HashTags ordered by count
===


Instagram has millions of photos, and each has tens of hashtags, so how does Instagram efficiently serves hashtags for a search query?

Instagram uses Postgres as its primary transactions database. For each hashtag, it stores the `media_count` in a table. This allows us to render the Hashtag and some meta information on the search page.

Note: Instagram could also use a dedicated search engine for this usecase, but this usecase is trivial to use something as sophisticated as ElasticSearch. We take a look at how they do it with Postgres.

A naive query to get hashtags for a given prefix ordered by count would look something like this

```
SELECT * from hashtags
WHERE name LIKE 'snow%'
ORDER BY media_count
DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Executing this query would require the database engine to filter out the hashtags starting with `snow` and then sort. Sorting is an expensive operation and this query required the engine to sort 15000 rows.

Under high load, this sorting becomes a pain. So, what's the way out?

The key insight here is the fact that hashtags have a long-tail distribution i.e. most hashtags will have far fewer media counts and while serving we are always ordering by `media_count`.

Hence, instead of indexing everything, we can simply index the hashtags having `media_count > 100` because other hashtags are highly unlikely to be surfaced.

## Partial Indexes

Postgres database has this exact same capability and it is called Partial Indexing. With partial indexes, we can keep only a subset of data in the index.

We can create a partial index on our hashtags table like

```
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON hashtags WHERE media_count > 100;
```

With this index, the query we fire would have to scan a very limited number of index entries to spit out the result.

The SQL query to get hashtags with the prefix `snow%` would look something like this

```
SELECT * from hashtags
WHERE name LIKE 'snow%'
AND media_count > 100
ORDER BY media_count
DESC LIMIT 10;
```

The above query required it to sort only 169 rows, completing its evaluation superfast. This is a classic usecase where we all can utilize Partial Indexes.

Instagram has millions of HashTags and millions of people tag their photos every single day. To discover, Instagram allows us to search for a Hash Tag.

In this video, we will take a detailed look into how Instagram efficiently searches for HashTags and serves them ordered by count; while doing so we will dive deep into a super-interesting Database optimization called Partial Indexes.

# Arpit's System Design Masterclass

> A masterclass that helps you become great at designing _scalable_, _fault-tolerant_, and _highly available_ systems.

## The Program

This is a prime and intermediate-level cohort-based course aimed at providing an exclusive and crisp learning experience. The program will cover most of the topics under System Design and Software Architecture including but not limited to - _Architecting Social Networks_, _Building Storage Engines_ and, _Designing High Throughput Systems_.

The program will have a blend of Live Classes happening on Weekends, and 1:1 Mentorship sessions. The program is designed to be intense and crisp to accelerate the overall learning. We tackle every system from the [First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) and build the solid foundation to architect any system in the future.


## Highlights

 - The course has been taken up by __500+__ people, spanning __9__ countries.
 - People from companies like Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Yelp, Github, Flipkart, Practo, Grab, PayPal, and many more, have taken up this course.


## Hi, I'm Arpit Bhayani üëã

<img width="256px" src="https://arpitbhayani.me/static/img/arpit.jpg" />

In my last **~10** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like _Search_, _Notification_, _Logging_, _Deployment Engine_, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

I also run a YouTube channel [#AsliEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani) where I post 3 videos every week spanning topics like System Design, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and any interesting CS concept in general.

You can find details about upcoming cohort üëá‚Äç Hope to see you soon there.
